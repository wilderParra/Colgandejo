# parseUtils
Library of Parse Snippets. Keeps growing. 

Parse is an amazing BAAS. And Angular is an amazing frontend-framework. Working with them together is great, but not so intuitive at first.
I've put together some stuff that I've learned on my Parse/Angular development, for future use.

There's a website that explains it all. You can find the website here: [Parse Utils](http://daniel.eledelab.co/parse)

Also, you can just use the files in the "standalone" folder. Just make sure you replace every instance of "Parse Key" or Pubnub Key with your own info. 

Also, feel free to change or add anything in here, this is a growing library of snippets, and it'll grow bigger with more people involved.
